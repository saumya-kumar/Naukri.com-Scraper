expain me this-Two most important python libraries that we would need for web scraping are requests and BeautifulSoup. Requests library is used for sending HTTP request to a web page, it returns a Response object with all the data from web page. BeautifulSoup is used to parse the HTTP returned response object in a tree like structure so that we can extract required data from the response object easily. However in this particular project we would also need selenium to get the HTML source of the web page. You don’t always need selenium for web scraping but when you are not able to get the HTML source as response then you can use it. I will show how it’s done in the following section.

The explanation provided highlights three key tools for web scraping in Python:

Requests: This is a Python library used to send HTTP requests to a webpage. The requests library makes it easy to retrieve the content of a web page, which is returned as a Response object. This object contains all the data from the web page, including the HTML content, headers, and other relevant details.

BeautifulSoup: Once the HTML response is received, BeautifulSoup is used to parse and navigate the data. It structures the content in a tree-like format (also known as a parse tree), allowing you to easily find and extract the specific data you need using tags, attributes, and classes.

Selenium: Unlike Requests, which directly sends requests to the server and gets HTML, Selenium is used for handling more complex scenarios where the content is dynamically generated, often by JavaScript (for example, when clicking a button or scrolling loads new data). In such cases, requests may not capture the required HTML source. Selenium automates web browsers, allowing you to interact with a page just like a user would (e.g., clicking buttons, filling forms), and can retrieve the dynamic HTML content that other tools might miss.

When to use Selenium: It's not always necessary for basic scraping, but when you encounter a page where the data is loaded dynamically (usually after the page initially loads), using Selenium ensures you can get the correct HTML content. This is particularly useful when requests alone don’t return the full source.


Common HTTP Status Codes:
200: Success (OK)
404: Not Found (the URL doesn't exist)
500: Internal Server Error (server-side issue)
